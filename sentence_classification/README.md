# Sentence Classification Framework
###### Simple classification framework based on IPython

Use IPython Notebook for the project. This help you build the system iteratively
making it easy to look at data and error categories.

You'll have to install the following to get started (if you don't already have).
- [`IPython Notebook`](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) _(which is now called Jupyter Notebook)_
- Following python libraries:
  - pandas
  - nltk
  - scikit-learn

Files:
- [preprocess.py](preprocess.py): this contains functions necessary for preprocessing dataset
- [feature_extractor.py](feature_extractor.py): this contains tfdif feature extractor
- [sentence_classification_notebook.ipynb](sentence_classification_notebook.ipynb): notebook where classification is done
